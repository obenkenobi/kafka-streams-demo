# Kafka Streams Demo

This demo is based on the [Kafka Streams 101 course](https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/kafka-streams/get-started/).

The difference here is we use docker compose with `./docker-compose.yml` to spin
up our kafka broker(s). Login to `localhost:3000` to inspect our kafka brokers.
